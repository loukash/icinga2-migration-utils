Due to some scheduling conflicts (vacation, conferences, ...) this is only a
placeholder. We will release icinga2-migration-utils in the 46th week of the
year. We are very sorry for the delay!

If you would like to receive a notification about the release you can follow

# Icinga Migration Utilities

Tools to help migration from Icinga 1.x to Icinga 2.x.

These tools are not meant to provide a full solution to perform the Icinga 1/2 migration since
every Icinga setup might be very different from one another.
The code still might contain some places that will not fit your setup.

Instead, this repository provides some basic tools to get started retrieving and comparing
data between Icinga 1.x and Icinga 2.x.
